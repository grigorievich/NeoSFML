/* Here is an overview of the workings of this program.
 * The way this C++ program communicates with a neovim instance is by 
 * running an embedded intepreter, which does pretty much all the dirty work.
 * The embedded interpreter has to communicate with the C++ program using
 * python bindings defined in PythonBindings.cpp.
 * Those bindings in turn call appropriate Neovim and DataHolder functions.
 * Neovim class manages renderers.
 * Renderers are: Background renderer, Foreground renderer, Blinky.
 * Renderers take the information about what to render from dataHolder kept
 * by Neovim class. Input and events also go through the Neovim class.
 */

/* The following class, on it's instantiation, fires up a Python interpreter.
 * It does so by calling runBridge provided by PythonBindings.hpp.
 * A separate thread for this is used because runBridge does not return.
 * Public bridgeData instance is used for communications between the
 * interpeter and screen with dataHolder.
 *
 * Mostly, though, this class is concerned with managing the work
 * of renderers: back/foreground renderer and blinky. 
 *
 * For the reason above, it also manages the access to the resources safely.
 *
 * First of all, when calling update(), if redraw was requested by nvim,
 * updateMutex is locked, which means that access to dataHolder is aquired 
 * (it can also be aquired by the python bindings). 
 * Now, the renderers can safely update themselves with new data.
 * 
 * The case of a resize initiated by nvim is handled specially.
 * Resize may not be called directly by nvim, because a drawing
 * operation might be taking place. Therefore, resizing is scheduled.
 * Also, after calling resize, nvim may not call any update functions
 * till the resize takes place. To ensure this, resizeMutex is used
 * (in addition to updateMutex).
 *
 * As for the communication in the opposite direction (UI -> nvim),
 * it is also managed here (by modifying bridgeData, later polled by nvim).
